# Hello, Minecraft!
Now that you have created your project it is time to actually make it function as a mod.
First if you have any in `src/main/java` delete it. Next you want to create your mod's main file.
For that create a new java in `src/main/java` file e.g. `myname.coolmod.CoolMod`.
That file should extend WaveMod. Here is an example of a main mod file.
If you are using InteliJ build system then for you both `src/main/java` and `src/main/resources` will be in `src`
```java
public class CoolMod extends WaveMod {
    private static CoolMod instance;
    public static Logger log;
    
    public CoolMod() {
        super("very_cool_mod", "1.0");
        instance = this;
        log = new Logger(this);
    }

    @Override
    public void init() {
        log.log("Hello, Minecraft!");
    }
    
    public static WaveMod getInstance() {
        return instance;
    }
}
```
You don't have to create instance variable and set it, but it is recommended you do that because you will need it later on.
Neither do you have to create a new Logger for your mod, but it is advised over using `System.out.println()` to use `Logger#log()`. <br>

Next step is to create `wave.yml` file inside your resources folder that will contain:
```yaml
main: path.to.MainClass
```
Now you are free to build your mod and run Minecraft.
and you should see `Hello, Minecraft!` somewhere inside your log.

That's it for the setup, no need for obfuscation, just a very plain gradle project!
